# inclusive-presentations-language

In this document, we summarize some general guideliness that you can follow to make sure the language of your presentations is more inclusive. The literature we reviewed is foused on two main problems, which are the most common ones

1. using generic masculine words or titles to refer to all persons, or to refer to an abstract "person" whom gender is not known. 

2. Using terms or expressions that reinforce inappropriate, outdated, or demeaning attitudes or assumptions about persons or groups based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

Moreover, if your work studies a subject (or includes data) that is related to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation, we strongly suggest you review this work with people whom might be represented in your data, and/or collagues from sociology, gender studies or queer studies departments, even before publishing. 

* The use of generalization from the data to characterize or stereothype any of the groups mentioned above is not recommended. Be specific, stay fact based and use inclusive language when talking about them. 
	


### General advise 

* How to welcome, refer or interact with your audience: 
	*  ❌ do not use: ladies and genetlman, boys and girls, men and women of the audience, brothers and siters, her or she, sir madam
	* ✅ instead, use : Esteemed guests, that person, friends and colleagues, students, siblings, everyone, the participants, faculty members. 

* When presenting, you might have to talk about people in the LGBTQ+ community.  Avoid oudated terms when refering to them. Some terms might be offensive because they could imply criminalization or pathologization or they could simply be misnomers.

	| ❌ outdated    | ✅alternative |
	|-------------|-------------|
	| "lifestyle" or "preference," | "orientation" or "identity." | 
	| transsexual  |     transgender (to mean a broader umbrella category) |
	| "biological man" or "biological woman," |  "cisgender man" or "cisgender woman" or perhaps "non-transgender man" or "non-transgender woman." |
	| "feminine/female pronouns", "masculine/male pronouns,"| "she/her pronouns" or "he/him pronouns." | 
	| "preferred gender pronouns," | "personal pronouns." | 
	|"transvestite,"  |"cross dresser."  | 
	| "hermaphrodite," | "intersex." | 
	| "homosexual," | "gay" or "lesbian." | 


* Avoid Inherently sexist words:  avoid using different words for men and women who perform the same job, and avoid using a masculine noun to encompass both; instead, use a non-gender specific title.

	| ❌ do not use    | ✅ alternative |
	|-------------|-------------|
	| mankind, man (general) | people, human beings, humanity |
	| mailman, policeman | letter carrier, police officer|
	| chairman | chair person|  
		

* inclusive language in other form of writing 

	



Example 1: In your presentation, make sure not all the subjects are of the same gender. Even better, don't assume a gender, unless it is necesary: 

- Instead of:  "When a student writes a paper, he must proofread carefully"
	-  refer to the subject in plural: "When students write their papers, they should use the spellcheckers
on their computers."
	
- Instead of : 	"Ask him to define the thesis"
- Substictute a noun subject instead of a pronoun :  sk the writer to define the thesis.

PROBLEM #2: The search for a gender-neutral singular pronoun
When the subject of a sentence is a specific but unidentified individual, making the subject plural does not make sense:
Who dropped his ticket? Somebody left his sweater.
In both of these sentences, the subject must be singular; only one person dropped the ticket and only one person left the sweater. Without resorting to using "his or her," how can we eliminate the sexism in these sentences?
Recommended Solution:
When possible, simply drop the pronoun altogether and substitute a nondescriptive article:
Who dropped a ticket? Somebody left a sweater.
Sometimes, revising the sentence in this way changes the meaning of what you're trying to say, in which case you'll have to search for other solutions. It is, however, an "easy way out" in some cases.
 
Another Option:
Ann Bodine of Rutgers University suggests a device she calls the singular "they." Consider the following sentences:
Who dropped their ticket?
Somebody left their sweater.
Using "they" in this context technically is not grammatically correct; however, more and more
people are starting to accept this usage as an alternative to sexist writing. You can also use this device to eliminate the use of "him or her"; consider the two sentences below:
Either Mary or John should bring a schedule with her or him.
Either Mary or John should bring a schedule with them. (Bodine 130-141) CAUTION: Recognize that the singular "they" is not grammatically correct. Some texts offer it as a solution, but we recommend that you be wary of using it in formal writing, as some professors may take offense. When in doubt, ask your professors what they prefer.
