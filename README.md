# diversity-inclusion

This repository collects the guideliness to run more inclusive and diverse conferences, using the ACM Recommender Systems conferences as an example 

## How to use the repository: 

- Have the code of conduct on the main page of the conference (see [example](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys18/) from RecSys2018)
- Have an email address that people can write to in case the code of conduct is not followed. 
- Go through the [event-planning list](https://github.com/hcorona/diversity-inclusion/blob/master/event-planning.md) with the conference organizers and think about what can you do, what can't you do. If any of the things you can not do might be a problem for some people, be transparent about why you are not able to acomodate people's needs. 
- Share with the people presenting the two guidelines for presentations:  [accessible  presentations](https://github.com/hcorona/diversity-inclusion/blob/master/accesible-presentations.md) and the [inclusive language in presentations](https://github.com/hcorona/diversity-inclusion/blob/master/inclusive-language-presentations.md). Make sure people are aware that they should follow these guideliness.
